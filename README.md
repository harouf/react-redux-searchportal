# React Redux Search Portal

---

## About

This is a resource search portal MVP that is built upon ReactJS:

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

## Building and Running Production Server

```
npm run build
npm run start
```


## Explanation

What initally gets run is `bin/server.js`, which does little more than enable ES6 and ES7 awesomeness in the
server-side node code. It then initiates `server.js`. In `server.js` we proxy any requests to `/api/*` to the
[API server](#api-server), running at `localhost:3030`. All the data fetching calls from the client go to `/api/*`.
Aside from serving the favicon and static content from `/static`, the only thing `server.js` does is initiate delegate
rendering to `react-router`. At the bottom of `server.js`, we listen to port `3000` and initiate the API server.

#### Routing and HTML return

The primary section of `server.js` generates an HTML page with the contents returned by `react-router`. First we instantiate an `ApiClient`, a facade that both server and client code use to talk to the API server. On the server side, `ApiClient` is given the request object so that it can pass along the session cookie to the API server to maintain session state. We pass this API client facade to the `redux` middleware so that the action creators have access to it.

Then we perform [server-side data fetching](#server-side-data-fetching), wait for the data to be loaded, and render the page with the now-fully-loaded `redux` state.

The last interesting bit of the main routing section of `server.js` is that we swap in the hashed script and css from the `webpack-stats.json` that the Webpack Dev Server – or the Webpack build process on production – has spit out on its last run. You won't have to deal with `webpack-stats.json` manually because [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools) take care of that.

We also spit out the `redux` state into a global `window.__data` variable in the webpage to be loaded by the client-side `redux` code.

#### Server-side Data Fetching

We ask `react-router` for a list of all the routes that match the current request and we check to see if any of the matched routes has a static `fetchData()` function. If it does, we pass the redux dispatcher to it and collect the promises returned. Those promises will be resolved when each matching route has loaded its necessary data from the API server.

#### Client Side

The client side entry point is reasonably named `client.js`. All it does is load the routes, initiate `react-router`, rehydrate the redux state from the `window.__data` passed in from the server, and render the page over top of the server-rendered DOM. This makes React enable all its event listeners without having to re-render the DOM.
